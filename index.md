### Audience
This class, provided by [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/), is intended for a M2-level audience with no advanced background in Computer Science or Maths (e.g. Neuro, Bio, Medical, etc.). The classes will be in English, and there will be a mixture of lectures and practical work (TP), with at-home assignments. For the practical parts, prior experience with Python programming will be required. 

If you need a refresher on the basics of Python programming before starting our class, you can try [[this course]](https://www.python-course.eu), [[this one]](https://thepythonguru.com/) or [[this one]](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming). 

Similarly, if you'd like to brush up math concepts that are relevant to modern AI, you could check [[this blog]](https://www.edureka.co/blog/mathematics-for-machine-learning/) or [[this one]](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/10/mathematics-behind-machine-learning/), or [[this two-hour video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyxqcS1u5go) or [[this one]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VSZtNYMntM). 

### Registration
Priority is given to M2 students from Universite de Toulouse. The classes may be open to other interested participants from ANITI or outside, based on availability. 

To register for the class, **it is mandatory to sign up** with the following form:
#### [Registration form](registration)

Once registered, you will receive the visio-conference links for each class.

### Grading
The class is offered in 2022 as an off-curriculum optional course. There will be no grades and no exams. 

We may deliver a certificate of attendance if you need one; however, this should be mentioned when you register, and in that case we will monitor your attendance, including participation in at-home assignments.
