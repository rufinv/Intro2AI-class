### Audience
This class, provided by [ANITI](https://aniti.univ-toulouse.fr/en/), is intended for a M2-level audience with no advanced background in Computer Science or Maths (e.g. Neuro, Bio, Medical, etc.). The classes will be in English, and there will be a mixture of lectures and practical work (TP), with at-home assignments. For the practical parts, prior experience with Python programming will be required. 

**Do you need a refresher on the basics of Python programming before starting our class?** To find out, look at [[this online course]](https://thepythonguru.com/), from lecture "Datatype and Variables" to lecture "Python object and classes" (included). There is nothing to install, all the code examples can be run interactively in the browser. If you already know all the concepts in this course, then your Python level is sufficient. If you're a beginner, it might take you 10+ hours to go through the course, but **this will be necessary** to follow our class...

Other useful resources include [[this course]](https://www.python-course.eu), or [[this one]](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming). 

Similarly, if you'd like to brush up math concepts that are relevant to modern AI, you could check [[this blog]](https://www.edureka.co/blog/mathematics-for-machine-learning/) or [[this one]](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/10/mathematics-behind-machine-learning/), or [[this two-hour video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyxqcS1u5go) or [[this one]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VSZtNYMntM).

### Registration
Priority is given to M2 students from Universite de Toulouse. The classes may be open to other interested participants from ANITI or outside, based on availability. 

To register for the class, **it is mandatory to sign up** with the following form:
#### [Registration form](registration)

Once registered, you will receive the visio-conference links for each class.

### Grading
Grading will be based on **individual projects**. Each student should choose **ONE** of the course notebooks (from lectures 1-9) and complement it with a *significant* personal work. Just create one or more cells at the end of the notebook, clearly marked with your personal addition. It could be a change in the model's architecture, an adaptation of the model to a new task or dataset, etc. If you lack inspiration, feel free to start from the "exercises" or personal work suggested at the end of each notebook (but projects with original and creative thinking will get extra points). The notebook should be returned (by email to rufin.vanrullen@cnrs.fr) on or before May 1st. This is a firm deadline, the grade will decrease by 1 point for each late day (e.g. if you send your notebook on May 11, the maximum grade you can get is 10/20). The main criteria for grading will be:
* The addition should be clearly marked in the notebook, e.g. with a title "MY PERSONAL ADDITION IN THE 3 CELLS BELOW"
* The addition should be explained (e.g. with comments in the code), so one can at least know what you intended to achieve
* The addition should be non-trivial
* The addition should reflect significant work and effort
* The addition should make it clear that the student has understood the lecture and notebook
* The addition should *work*, i.e. it should be possible to evaluate the cells without returning an error.

<!-- The class is offered in 2022 as an off-curriculum optional course. There will be no grades and no exams. 

We may deliver a certificate of attendance if you need one; however, this should be mentioned when you register, and in that case we will monitor your attendance, including participation in at-home assignments. -->
