## Frequently Asked Questions


* Will the slides be available before/after the class?

This is up to each individual teacher. Some have decided to post the slides in advance, others prefer to provide them after the class. In both cases, 
you should check for links in the corresponding Lecture page.

* Will the practical tutorials/notebooks be available before the class?

We will make the notebooks available a couple days in advance of each class (check for links in the corresponding Lecture page). This will give you 
time to download them and play with them if you wish. It is not mandatory to download them in advance, this can also be done together, 
as a separate "practical time" will be reserved at the end of each Lecture. 

<!-- 
* Can I ask questions during the class?

Yes. feel free to unmute your mike and interrupt at any time. This is especially important when concepts need to be clarified. 
On the other hand, we do have a lot of ground to cover, so please let's not turn the class into a full-blown discussion. 
There are other opportunities for discussion of the concepts introduced in class--in particular, you can use our slack workspace 
to chat directly with the teachers and other students, both before and after each class. 

* Should I leave my camera on/off during the class?

This is up to you, but it would be nice if 3 or 4 students with good internet connections would agree to keep their video 
on--it's not very friendly for teachers to talk to a wall of black screens. 
-->
* I may not be able to attend one or two classes, will the sessions be recorded?

We will not record this year's session. But previous years' videos have been recorded and will be made available for a few weeks after the class. 
This will allow students to catch up, or to return to the recordings and review any part they did not understand.

<!-- 
* Can I share the zoom link with other people not registered for the class?

In theory, unregistered students cannot attend the class. 
In practice, however, there is nothing to stop them from watching the zoom sessions. We won't be monitoring the list of participants, 
or checking their registration. The only thing that we would request is that only the "registered" students can interrupt the class 
and ask questions--otherwise it will be chaos...

* Can I share the link to the class video recordings with other (unregistered) people?

Feel free to share these links with individual people. Just don't post them on a public website.
* Where can I get help about the practical parts, Jupyter notebooks, tutorials and assignments?

Send a message on Slack. You can chat directly with a given teacher, or with the whole class.

* Where are the links (zoom calls, slack workspace, video recordings...)?

You should receive direct emails with each link. Contact us if you haven't received anything.
